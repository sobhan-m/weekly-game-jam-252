# Description
This game was originally conceived as a submission for the [Weekly Game Jam - Week 252](https://itch.io/jam/weekly-game-jam-252), but I was not able to complete it in time to submit.

It is a top-down shooter about fighting off animated food objects (based on the jam's theme of "food").
